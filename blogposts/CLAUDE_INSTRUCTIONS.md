## Notes for Claude

1. **Always prioritize honesty** — This is Fenlo AI's core differentiator. Don't shy away from saying when AI might not be the right choice.

2. **Think like a small business owner** — They're skeptical, busy, and have been burned by overpromising tech vendors before.

3. **Focus on outcomes** — They care about saving time, reducing costs, and growing their business — not about the technology itself.

4. **Keep it practical** — Every post should leave readers with something they can think about or act on immediately.

5. **Maintain the light aesthetic** — Write in a way that feels open, clean, and approachable — not heavy, dark, or overwhelming.

6. **Service alignment** — When relevant, naturally connect content to Fenlo AI's specific services, but never force it.

7. **CTA is essential** — Every blog post must end with a clear, compelling call-to-action to book a discovery call.
