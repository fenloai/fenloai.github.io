**Goal:** Demystify FAQ bots in plain English

**Key Points:**
- Simple definition: A digital assistant that answers your customers' common questions automatically
- How it works: Customer asks question → Bot understands intent → Bot retrieves answer from your knowledge base
- Two types: Rule-based (scripted) vs. AI-driven (learns and adapts)
- What they're NOT: Not a replacement for human support on complex issues

**Supporting Data:**
- 92% of support tickets in small stores are routine inquiries (order tracking, product questions, returns, shipping) [AddWebSolution, 2025]

### Section 5: When an FAQ Bot Makes Sense (And When It Doesn't)
**Goal:** Help readers self-qualify honestly (aligns with Fenlo AI's "say no when appropriate" philosophy)

**An FAQ Bot Probably Makes Sense If:**
- You're answering the same 10-20 questions repeatedly
- Your team spends more than 2 hours daily on routine inquiries
- You're missing inquiries outside business hours
- Customer wait times are hurting satisfaction
- You're growing but can't afford proportional hiring
- 75% of SMBs are now experimenting with chatbots for these exact reasons

**An FAQ Bot Might NOT Be Right If:**
- You have very few customer inquiries (under 20/week)
- Most of your inquiries are complex, unique situations
- You haven't documented your common questions and answers yet
- Your business processes aren't stable (automation amplifies chaos)
- You're looking for a "set it and forget it" solution (bots need maintenance)

**Key Insight:** Automation amplifies existing processes. If your support is disorganized, a bot will just be disorganized faster. Fix your foundations first.

### Section 6: Getting Started: A Practical Checklist
**Goal:** Give readers immediate actionable value

**Before You Invest in an FAQ Bot:**

1. **Document your top 20 questions** - What do customers ask most often?
2. **Write out your current answers** - This becomes your bot's knowledge base
3. **Calculate your current support volume** - How many hours weekly on routine questions?
4. **Identify your primary channel** - Website? WhatsApp? Email?
5. **Set realistic expectations** - Start with FAQ automation for common questions (40-60% of volume) before expanding

**Quick Win:** Even just documenting your FAQs can improve human agent efficiency while you evaluate automation options.

### Conclusion
**Goal:** Summarize key insights and transition to CTA

**Key Takeaways:**
- FAQ bots handle routine questions automatically, freeing your team for complex issues

2. **Use specific numbers** - "$300,000" is more credible than "significant savings"

3. **Include the honest caveat** - The 44% negative outcome statistic shows we're not just cherry-picking success stories

4. **Connect to Fenlo AI naturally** - The "when it doesn't make sense" section perfectly aligns with Fenlo's "we say no when AI isn't right" positioning

5. **Keep paragraphs short** - Max 3-4 sentences for scannability

6. **Use "you" and "your business"** - Direct address throughout
