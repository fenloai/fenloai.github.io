   - 80% of routine HR questions can become self-service

   - Quickly find past proposals, case studies, pricing
   - Spend time selling, not searching

### 6. When Document Q&A Might NOT Be Right for You
**Key Message:** Honest assessment of limitations (Fenlo AI differentiator).

**Callout Box - Be Honest:**

**Skip document Q&A if:**
- You have very few documents (under ~50 key docs)
- Your documents are already well-organized and easily searchable
- Most questions require human judgment, not information retrieval
- Your team is very small (1-3 people who know everything already)

**Consider it if:**
- Same questions get asked repeatedly
- New employees take months to "learn where everything is"
- Audits/compliance require quick document searches
- Staff regularly complain about finding information
- You're scaling and can't keep relying on people's memory

**Key Insight Box:**
"We've told clients 'no' when document Q&A wasn't the right fit. Automation amplifies what you already have — if your documents are a mess, you might need organization before AI."

---

### 7. What Implementation Actually Looks Like
**Key Message:** It's simpler than you might think, but there are real steps involved.

**Implementation Checklist:**

1. **Document Audit** (~1-2 days)
   - What documents exist? Where are they?
   - Which are frequently referenced?

2. **Content Preparation** (varies)
   - Ensure documents are in readable formats
   - Clean up severely outdated content

3. **System Setup** (~1-2 weeks)
   - Connect document sources
   - Configure AI for your domain/terminology

4. **Testing & Refinement** (~1 week)
   - Test with real questions
   - Fine-tune responses

5. **Team Rollout**
   - Brief training (usually minimal)
   - Gather feedback, iterate

**Realistic Timeline:** 2-4 weeks for most SME deployments

---

### 8. The Bottom Line: Is It Worth It?
**Key Message:** For the right situations, the ROI is clear and fast.

**Summary Points:**
- Time savings compound quickly (hours/week → hundreds of hours/year)
- Error reduction has downstream value (fewer mistakes, better decisions)
- Employee satisfaction matters (people like tools that help, not frustrate)
- Knowledge retention protects against turnover

**Comparison to Alternatives:**
- Hiring another admin just to answer questions: $$$ ongoing
- Better folder organization: helps but doesn't scale
- "Ask Steve" culture: fragile, Steve might leave

---

### 9. Conclusion & CTA
**Key Message:** If information retrieval is a hidden tax on your team's time, it's worth exploring.

**Final Paragraph:**
Summarize that document Q&A isn't magic — it's a practical tool that works well for specific situations. For SMEs drowning in documents and repeated questions, the time savings alone often justify the investment within months.
